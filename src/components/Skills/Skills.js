		    Languages I have experiencing writing include HTML&CSS, Java, Javascript,
		    PHP and some frameworks like Bootstrap, tachyons. Most of which were derived
		    from projects at university. I am proficient with Git, Vim and I have some fundamental
		    knowledge in languages like Python and C++ but I have not implemented any solutions using 
		    these languages that is not to say I do not plan to.

		    I am currently exploring the use of ReactJs and NodeJs. This portfolio was built using
		    react!
